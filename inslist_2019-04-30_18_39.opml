The  **@SuppressAnnotation**  is used to suppress Lint warnings in Java files. However, while many lint checks analyzes the Java source code, where they can find annotations on (for example) local variables, some checks are analyzing the  **.class**  files. And in class files, annotations only appear on classes, fields and methods. Annotations placed on local variables disappear. If you attempt to suppress a lint error for a class-file based lint check, the suppress annotation not work. You must move the annotation out to the surrounding method.

In Android O, the  **findViewById**  signature switched to using generics, which means that most of the time you can leave out explicit casts and just assign the result of the  **findViewById**  call to variables of specific view classes.<br/>

However, due to language changes between Java 7 and 8, this change may cause code to not compile without explicit casts. This lint check looks for these scenarios and suggests casts to be added now such that the code will continue to compile if the language level is updated to 1.8.

In order to support features such as tinting, the appcompat library will automatically load special appcompat replacements for the builtin widgets. However, this does not work for your own custom views.<br/>

Instead of extending the  **android.widget**  classes directly, you should instead extend one of the delegate classes in  **android.support.v7.widget.AppCompat** .
Issue id: AppCompatCustomView" ></outline><outline text="Assertions" _note="Assertions
Assertions are not checked at runtime. There are ways to request that they be used by Dalvik ( **adb shell setprop debug.assert 1** ), but note that this is not implemented in ART (the newer runtime), and even in Dalvik the property is ignored in many places and can not be relied upon. Instead, perform conditional checking inside  **if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { }**  blocks. That constant is a static final boolean which is true in debug builds and false in release builds, and the Java compiler completely removes all code inside the if-body from the app.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you can replace  **assert speed > 0**  with  **if (BuildConfig.DEBUG &amp;&amp; !(speed > 0)) { throw new AssertionError() }** .<br/>

(Note: This lint check does not flag assertions purely asserting nullness or non-nullness; these are typically more intended for tools usage than runtime checks.)

This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with the  **minSdkVersion**  attribute).<br/>

This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute. However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer attribute.<br/>

This check scans through all the Android API calls in the application and warns about any calls that are not available on  **all**  versions targeted by this application (according to its minimum SDK attribute in the manifest).<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to use this API and don't need to support older devices just set the  **minSdkVersion**  in your  **build.gradle**  or  **AndroidManifest.xml**  files.<br/>
<br/>
If your code is  **deliberately**  accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the  **@TargetApi**  annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as  **@TargetApi(11)** , such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file's minimum SDK as the required API level.<br/>
<br/>
If you are deliberately setting  **android:**  attributes in style definitions, make sure you place this in a  **values-v** <i>NN</i> folder in order to avoid running into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.<br/>

<br/>
If you are writing your own classes into the  **Parcel**  (not just SDK classes like  **String**  and so on), then you should supply a  **ClassLoader**  for your application instead; a simple way to obtain one is to just call  **getClass().getClassLoader()**  from your own class.

Gradle will let you replace specific constants in your build scripts with method calls, so you can for example dynamically compute a version string based on your current version control revision number, rather than hardcoding a number.<br/>
<br/>
When computing a version name, it's tempting to for example call the method to do that  **getVersionName** . However, when you put that method call inside the  **defaultConfig**  block, you will actually be calling the Groovy getter for the  **versionName**  property instead.

Calling  **String#toLowerCase()**  or  **#toUpperCase()**   **without specifying an explicit locale**  is a common source of bugs.

For example, in the Turkish locale, the uppercase replacement for  **i**  is  **not**   **I** .<br/>

NOTE: Not all Strings which look like formatting strings are intended for use by  **String.format** ; for example, they may contain date formats intended for  **android.text.format.Time#format()** .

Different languages have different rules for grammatical agreement with quantity. In English, for example, the quantity 1 is a special case. We write '1 book', but for any other quantity we'd write 'n books'. This distinction between singular and plural is very common, but other languages make finer distinctions.<br/>
<br/>
This lint check looks at each translation of a  **&lt;plural>**  and makes sure that all the quantity strings considered by the given language are provided by this translation.<br/>

For example, an English translation must provide a string for  **quantity='one'** . Similarly, a Czech translation must provide a string for  **quantity='few'** .

This lint check looks for potential errors in internationalization where you have translated a message which involves a quantity and it looks like other parts of the string may need grammatical changes.<br/>
<br/>
For example, rather than something like this:<br/>

you should be using a plural:<br/>

Android defines a number of different quantity strings, such as  **zero** ,  **one** ,  **few**  and  **many** . However, many languages do not distinguish grammatically between all these different quantities.<br/>
<br/>
This lint check looks at the quantity strings defined for each translation and flags any quantity strings that are unused (because the language does not make that quantity distinction, and Android will therefore not look it up).<br/>
<br/>
For example, in Chinese, only the  **other**  quantity is used, so even if you provide translations for  **zero**  and  **one** , these strings will  **not**  be returned when  **getQuantityString()**  is called, even with  **0**  or  **1** .

Suppose you are building against Android API 8, and you've subclassed Activity. In your subclass you add a new method called  **isDestroyed** (). At some later point, a method of the same name and signature is added to Android. Your method will now override the Android method, and possibly break its contract.

<br/>
The above scenario is what this lint detector looks for.

In SQLite, any column can store any data type; the declared type for a column is more of a hint as to what the data should be cast to when stored.<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways to store a string.  **TEXT** ,  **VARCHAR** ,  **CHARACTER**  and  **CLOB**  are string types,  **but `STRING` is not** . Columns defined as STRING are actually numeric.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to store a value in a numeric column, SQLite will try to cast it to a float or an integer before storing. If it can't, it will just store it as a string.<br/>
<br/>
This can lead to some subtle bugs. For example, when SQLite encounters a string like  **1234567e1234** , it will parse it as a float, but the result will be out of range for floating point numbers, so  **Inf**  will be stored! Similarly, strings that look like integers will lose leading zeroes.<br/>
<br/>
To fix this, you can change your schema to use a  **TEXT**  type instead.

If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called 'overdraw'.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.<br/>
<br/>
If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

confusing, and often the result of a typo.

" ></outline><outline text="Nested 'synchronized' statement" _note="
Reports nested  **synchronized**  statements. Nested  **synchronized**  statements

" ></outline><outline text="Non-private field accessed in synchronized context" _note="
Reports non- **final** , non- **private**  fields which are accessed in a synchronized context.
A non-private field cannot be guaranteed to always be accessed in a synchronized manner, and such 'partially synchronized'
access may result in unexpectedly inconsistent data structures. Accesses in constructors an initializers are ignored
for purposes of this inspection.

" ></outline><outline text="Synchronization on 'this'" _note="
Reports synchronization which uses  **this**  as its lock
expression. Constructs reported include  **synchronized** 
blocks which lock  **this** , and calls to  **wait()** 
 **notify()**  or  **notifyAll()**  which target  **wait()** .
Such constructs, like synchronized methods, make it hard to track just who is locking on a given
object, and make possible 'denial of service' attacks on objects. As an alternative, consider
locking on a private instance variable, access to which can be completely controlled.

" ></outline><outline text="Synchronization on non-final field" _note="
Reports  **synchronized**  statements where the lock expression
is a non- **final**  field. Such statements are unlikely to have useful semantics, as different
threads may be locking on different objects even when operating on the same object.

" ></outline><outline text="Synchronization on variable initialized with literal" _note="
Reports synchronized blocks which lock on an object which is initialized with a
literal. String literals are interned and  **Number**  literals can be allocated from a cache. Because of
this, it is possible that some other part of the system which uses an object initialized with the same
literal, is actually holding a reference to the exact same object. This can create unexpected dead-lock
situations, if the string was thought to be private.

" ></outline><outline text="Synchronized method" _note="
Reports the  **synchronized**  modifier on methods. Some coding standards
prohibit the use of the  **synchronized**  modifier, in favor of  **synchronized**  statements.

" ></outline><outline text="Unconditional 'wait' call" _note="
Reports  **wait()** 
being called unconditionally within a synchronized context.
Normally,  **wait()**  is
used to block a thread until some condition is true. If  **wait()** 
is called unconditionally, that often indicates that the condition was checked before a lock was
acquired. In that case a data race may occur, with the condition becoming true between the time
it was checked and the time the lock was acquired. While constructs found by this inspection
are not necessarily incorrect, they are certainly worth examining.

" ></outline><outline text="Unsynchronized method overrides synchronized method" _note="
Reports non- **synchronized** methods overriding  **synchronized**  methods.

" ></outline><outline text="While loop spins on field" _note="
Reports  **while**  loops which spin on the
value of a non- **volatile**  field, waiting for it to be changed by another thread. In addition to being potentially
extremely CPU intensive when little work is done inside the loop, such
loops are likely have different semantics than intended, as the Java Memory Model allows such field accesses
to be hoisted out of the loop, causing the loop to never complete even if another thread does change the
field's value.

In an interface it is possible to declare those methods with a return type that is incompatible with the  **java.lang.Object**  methods.

Reports any  **interface**  that may be annotated as  **@FunctionalInterface** , which is available in JDK 1.8.
Annotating an interface with  **@FunctionalInterface**  can be useful to indicate that the interface is supposed to be functional and
further  **abstract**  methods should not be added to it.
This inspection only reports if the project or module is configured to use a language level of 8.0 or higher.

resulting in obscure bugs.
This inspection does not warn on instance initializers in anonymous classes.
<!-- tooltip end -->

Use the checkbox below to ignore instance initializers in classes which do not have any constructors.


" ></outline><outline text="Parameter can be local" _note="

This inspection searches for redundant method parameters that can be replaced with local variables.
If all local usages of a parameter are preceded by assignments to that parameter, the
parameter can be removed and its usages replaced with local variables.

" ></outline><outline text="Singleton" _note="
Reports singleton classes.
Singleton classes are declared so that only one instance of the

" ></outline><outline text="Utility class" _note="
Reports utility classes.
Utility classes have all fields and methods declared  **static** , and their

To avoid code coverage problems in  **private**  constructors, some coding styles mandate that utility classes are implemented as enums.
<!-- tooltip end -->

" ></outline><outline text="Utility class is not 'final'" _note="
Reports utility classes which are not final.
Utility classes have all fields and methods declared  **static** . Giving such classes making them  **final**

Reports  **clone()**  methods which are not declared as throwing
 **CloneNotSupportedException** . If  **clone()**  is not declared

Use the checkbox below to indicate if this inspection should only warn on  **protected**  methods.
In <i>Effective Java, Second Edition</i> (but not in the first edition) it is recommended to omit the  **CloneNotSupportedException** 
declaration on  **public**  methods, because methods that don't throw checked exceptions are easier to use.


" ></outline><outline text="'clone()' instantiates objects with constructor" _note="
Reports calls to object constructors inside  **clone()**  methods.
Instantiation of objects inside of  **clone()**  should be done by calling  **clone()** ,

Use the checkbox below to indicate if this inspection should only warn on  **public**  methods.
Classes designed for inheritance may choose to override  **clone** () and declare it  **protected** 
without implementing  **Cloneable**  to give subclasses the choice to implement it.


" ></outline><outline text="'clone()' method not 'public'" _note="
Reports  **clone()**  methods that are  **protected**  and not  **public** .
When overriding the  **clone()**  method from  **java.lang.Object**  it is convention to make the method  **public** ,

See also the documentation of  **java.lang.Cloneable** 
<!-- tooltip end -->

" ></outline><outline text="'clone()' should have return type equal to the class it contains" _note="
Reports  **clone()**  methods that have a return type different than the class they are contained in.
Often a  **clone()**  method will have a return type of  **java.lang.Object** , which makes it harder to use by its clients.
<i>Effective Java, Second Edition</i> recommends for the return type of the  **clone()**  method to be
the class type of the object it returns.
<!-- tooltip end -->

" ></outline><outline text="Cloneable class without 'clone()' method" _note="
Reports classes which implement the  **Cloneable**  interface, but which do not override the
 **clone()**  method. Such classes use the default implementation of  **clone()** , which is often not the desired
behavior.
<!-- tooltip end -->


" ></outline><outline text="Use of 'clone()' or 'Cloneable'" _note="
Reports calls to and implementations of the  **clone()**  method and uses of  **java.lang.Cloneable** .
Some coding standards prohibit  **clone()**  usage, and recommend using a copy constructor or  **static**  factory method.
Calls to  **clone()**  on arrays are ignored, because that is a common, correct, efficient and compact way to copy an array.

" ></outline><outline text="'return' separated from the result computation" _note="
This inspection detects  **return**  statements which return a local variable, where the value of the variable is computed
somewhere else within the same code block with the  **return**  statement.
The quick fix inlines the returned variable by moving the return statement to the location where the value of the variable is computed.
  When the returned value can't be inlined into return statement, the quick fix attempts to move the return statement as close to the
  computation of the returned value as possible.
For example, the code below could be simplified:
<pre> **int n = -1;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {
    if (a[i] == b) {
        n = i;

<hr>
<h4>Use bounded wildcards to increase API flexibility.</h4>
<i>
Using wildcard types in your APIs, while tricky, makes the APIs far more flexible.
Remember the basic rule: producer-extends, consumer-super (PECS).
And remember that all Comparables and Comparators are consumers.
</i>
<hr>
Example:
   **<pre>void process(Consumer&lt;Number&gt; consumer);</pre>**  should be replaced with:
   **<pre>void process(Consumer&lt;? super Number&gt; consumer);</pre>** 
  This method signature is more flexible because it accepts more types (not only Consumer&lt;Number&gt; but also Consumer&lt;Object&gt;).

  Likewise, type parameters in covariant position:
   **<pre>T produce(Producer&lt;T&gt; p);</pre>** should be replaced with:
   **<pre>T produce(Producer&lt;? extends T&gt; p);</pre>**

The quick fix for the inspection removes braces from the statement body.

" ></outline><outline text="Conditional can be replaced with Optional" _note="
Suggests to replace a null-check condition with an  **Optional**  chain. E.g.
<pre>return str == null ? '' : str.trim();</pre>
Could be rewritten as

While the replacement is not always shorter, this could be a helpful step for further refactoring

Reports 'if' statements which can be replaced with condition using '&&', '||' or '?:' operator.
The result is usually shorter, but not always more clear, so it's not advised to apply it everywhere.
Also this change may reduce compiled bytecode size which could be useful in some environments like J2ME.

  Example:  **if (<i>condition</i>) return true; else return <i>foo</i>;**  could be replaced with

 The quick fix adds generic parameters to the variable type. The result would be like the following:
<pre> **List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;()** </pre>

" ></outline><outline text="Redundant 'new' expression in constant array creation" _note="
Reports any constant new array expression, like  **int[] a = new int[]{42}**  which can be replaced

A constructor is unnecessary if it is the only constructor of a class, has no parameters,

Use the checkbox below to ignore unnecessary constructors which have an annotation.


" ></outline><outline text="Return of 'this'" _note="
Reports methods returning  **this** .
While such a return is valid, it is rarely necessary, and usually indicates that the developer intends the method to be used

Reports methods and constructors where constant charset String literal is used (like  **'UTF-8'** ) which could be replaced with
a predefined Charset object like  **StandardCharsets.UTF_8** . This may work a little bit faster, because charset lookup becomes
unnecessary. Also catching  **UnsupportedEncodingException**  may become unnecessary as well. In this case the catch block will

  Use the checkboxes below to ignore comparisons of the form <tt>obj != null</tt> or <tt>num != 0</tt>.
  Since <tt>obj != null</tt> effectively means 'obj exists',
  the meaning of the whole expression does not involve any negation
  and is therefore easy to understand.

  The same reasoning applies to <tt>num != 0</tt> expressions, especially when using bit masks.

  These forms have the added benefit of mentioning the interesting case first.
  In most cases, the value for the <tt>== null</tt> branch is <tt>null</tt> itself,
  like in the following examples:
<pre>

Reports 'fall-through' in a  **switch**  statement.
Fall-through is defined to occur when a series of executable statements after a  **case**  label is not guaranteed

In that case, control falls through to the statements after
that  **switch**  label, even though the  **switch**  expression does not equal

The inspection detects a situation where Java 9 module A requires Java 9 module B, but A doesn't use any package from B.
Also, requiring the module 'java.base' is redundant.

Reports any calls to  **String.startsWith()**  or
 **String.endsWith()**  which are passed single character string
literals as parameter. Such calls may be more efficiently implemented with
 **String.charAt()** . Because the performance gain is
minimal, the needed extra check for non-zero length, and the negative effect on

" ></outline><outline text="Synthetic accessor call" _note="
This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.

Reports references to non-constant  **private**  members of a different class,
for which javac will generate a package-private synthetic accessor method.

An inner class and its containing class are compiled to separate
class files. The Java virtual machine normally prohibits access from a class to private fields and methods of
another class. To enable access from an inner class to private members of a
containing class or the other way around javac creates a package-private
synthetic accessor method. Less use of memory and greater performance may be achieved by making the
member package-private, thus allowing direct access without the creation of a synthetic accessor method.

This inspection does not report anything if language level is set to Java 11 or higher
as thanks to nest-based access control (JEP 181), accessor methods are not generated anymore.

" ></outline><outline text="Integer division in floating point context" _note="
Reports integer division where the
result is either directly or indirectly used as a floating point number.
Such division is often an error, and may result in unexpected results
due to the truncation that happens in integer division.
<!-- tooltip end -->


" ></outline><outline text="Integer multiplication or shift implicitly cast to long" _note="
Reports integer multiplications or left shifts which are implicitly cast to long.
For example:
<pre> **
   **void**  x(int i) {
     **long**  val = 65536 * i;
  }
** </pre>
Such multiplication is often a mistake, as overflow truncation may occur unexpectedly.
Converting the  **int**  literal to a  **long**  literal ( **65536L** ) fixes the problem.

" ></outline><outline text="Number constructor call with primitive argument" _note="
Reports any attempt to instantiate a new  **Long** ,
 **Integer** ,  **Short**  or
 **Byte**  object from a primitive  **long** ,
 **integer** ,  **short**  or
 **byte** 
argument. It may be more efficient to use the static method  **valueOf()**

127 inclusive.

This inspection only reports if the project or module is configured to use a
language level of 5.0 or higher.
<!-- tooltip end -->

Use the first checkbox below to ignore calls to number constructors with a  **String**  argument.

Use the second checkbox to only report calls to deprecated constructors.
 **Long** ,  **Integer** ,  **Short**  and **Byte**  constructors are deprecated since JDK 9.
" ></outline><outline text="Numeric cast that loses precision" _note="
Reports any cast operations between primitive numeric types which may
result in loss of precision. Such casts are not necessarily a problem, but may result in difficult to
trace bugs if the loss of precision is unexpected.
<!-- tooltip end -->

Use the first checkbox below to indicate that this inspection should ignore casts from
 **int**  to  **char** .
This type of cast is often used when implementing I/O operations, because the
 **read()**  method of the class
 **java.io.Reader**  returns an  **int** .

  Use the second checkbox below to ignore casts of constant values 128-255 from  **int**  to  **byte** .
  Such values will overflow to negative numbers that still fit inside a byte.
" ></outline><outline text="Numeric overflow" _note="
This inspection checks for expressions which overflow during computation, i.e.: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **<font color='#000080'>a = 1.0/0.0;</font>** 

" ></outline><outline text="Octal and decimal integers in same array" _note="
Reports mixed octal and decimal integer literals in a single array initializer.
This is often due to copying a list of numbers into an array initializer, where
some of the numbers in the array are zero-padded, and will thus be interpreted by the Java compiler as octal.
<!-- tooltip end -->


" ></outline><outline text="Octal integer" _note="
Reports octal integer literals. Some coding standards prohibit the
use of octal literals, as they may be easily confused with decimal literals.

Use the field below to specify the maximum number of terms allowed in an arithmetic expression.


" ></outline><outline text="Pointless arithmetic expression" _note="
Reports pointless arithmetic
expressions. Such expressions include adding or subtracting zero, multiplying by zero or one and
division by one. Such expressions may be the result of automated refactorings
not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
intended to do.
<!-- tooltip end -->


" ></outline><outline text="Suspicious test for oddness" _note="
Reports any checks for oddness of the form:
 **<pre>x % 2 == 1</pre>** 
Such checks will fail for negative odd values, which is probably not the behaviour intended. Consider using:
 **<pre>x % 2 != 0</pre>**  or:  **<pre>(x & 1) == 1</pre>**  instead.

" ></outline><outline text="Unary plus" _note="
Reports any uses of the unary  **+**  operator. Unary plus is usually a null operation, and
its presence may represent a coding error.
Particularly in combination with the increment operator,  **+++** , or the equals operator,  **=+** 
<!-- tooltip end -->

Use the checkbox below to only report when an unary plus is used together with a binary or another unary expression.
This means the inspection won't warn when an unary plus expression is used for example as a method argument, or in an array
initializer expression. In such cases it is much less confusing.


" ></outline><outline text="Unnecessary explicit numeric cast" _note="
Reports any primitive numeric casts which would otherwise be inserted implicitly by the compiler.
Also reports any primitive numeric casts which the compiler will remove.
For example:
<pre> **
   **int**  x = ( **short** )5; // cast will be removed by javac
** </pre>

" ></outline><outline text="Unnecessary unary minus" _note="
Reports any unnecessary unary minuses.

For example:
 **<pre>
    i += -8;
    i = i + -8;
</pre>** 
could be replaced by:
 **<pre>
    i -= 8;
    i = i - 8;
</pre>** 
<!-- tooltip end -->


" ></outline><outline text="Unpredictable BigDecimal constructor call" _note="
Reports on calls to  **BigDecimal** 
constructors which accept a  **double**  value.
These constructors can have somewhat unpredictable results because many numbers
cannot be represented exactly in a  **double** .
It is recommended to use the  **BigDecimal.valueOf()**  method or the constructors which accept a  **String**  instead.

Report packages which contain only classes extending  **java.lang.Throwable** , either directly or indirectly.
Although exceptions usually don't depend on other classes for their implementation, they are normally not used separately.
It is often a better design to locate exceptions in the same package as the classes that use them.

" ></outline></outline><outline text="Performance" ><outline text="'Collection.toArray()' call style" _note="
There are two styles to convert a collection to an array: either using a pre-sized array
(like  **c.toArray(new String[c.size()])** ) or using an empty array (like
 **c.toArray(new String[0])** .

  In older Java versions using pre-sized array was recommended, as the reflection
  call which is necessary to create an array of proper size was quite slow.
  However since late updates of OpenJDK 6 this call was intrinsified, making
  the performance of the empty array version the same and sometimes even better, compared
  to the pre-sized version. Also passing pre-sized array is dangerous for a concurrent or
  synchronized collection as a data race is possible between the  **size**  and  **toArray** 
  call which may result in extra nulls at the end of the array, if the collection was concurrently
  shrunk during the operation.
</p>

  This inspection allows to follow the uniform style: either using an empty array
  (which is recommended in modern Java)
  or using a pre-sized array (which might be faster in older Java versions or non-HotSpot based JVMs).

" ></outline><outline text="'equals()' call can be replaced with '=='" _note="
Reports calls to  **equals()**  which can be replaced by  **==**  or  **!=**  expressions without a change in semantics.
These calls can be replaced when they are used to compare  **final**  classes which don't have their own  **equals()**  implementation,
but use the default  **Object.equals()** .
This may result in better performance.

problems because those methods uses a DNS lookup
to determine the equality of two  **java.net.URL**  objects.
Depending on the availability of the network and the speed of the DNS server, this can cause
significant delays.

" ></outline><outline text="'List.remove()' called in loop" _note="
Reports  **List.remove(index)**  called in a loop, which can be replaced with  **List.subList().clear()** . The replacement
is more efficient for most List implementations, when many elements are deleted.

  The quick-fix adds a range-check automatically to prevent a possible  **IndexOutOfBoundsException**  when the minimal value is bigger
  than the maximal value. It can be removed if such a situation is impossible in your code.

Reports cases when  **.equals()**  is called to compare a String with an empty string. In this case, using  **.isEmpty()**  is better as
it shows you exactly what you're checking.
<!-- tooltip end -->

   **''.equals(str)**  returns false when  **str**  is null. For safety, this inspection's quick fix inserts an explicit null-check when

with either a call to  **Collections.singletonList()**  or  **Collections.emptyList()**  which will save some memory.
Note: the list returned by  **Collections.singletonList()**  is immutable, while the list returned  **Arrays.asList()**  allows
calling the  **set()**  method. This may break the code in rare cases.

Reports any attempt to instantiate a new  **Collection**  object without specifying
an initial capacity. If no initial capacity is specified, a default capacity is used, which will rarely be optimal. Failing

This inspection analyzes method control and data flow to report possible conditions that are always  **true**  or  **false** ,

More complex contracts can be defined using  **@Contract**  annotation, for example:<p/>
 **@Contract('_, null -> null')**  &mdash; method returns null if its second argument is null<br/>
 **@Contract('_, null -> null; _, !null -> !null')**  &mdash; method returns null if its second argument is null and not-null otherwise<br/>
 **@Contract('true -> fail')**  &mdash; a typical  **assertFalse**  method which throws an exception if  **true**  is passed to it<br/>

Often this is the result of mistakenly concatenating a string format argument by typing
a '+' when a ',' was meant.

Reports any  **new StringBuffer()**

cast to an integer and interpreted as initial capacity of the buffer. Usually this is
not what was intended.

" ></outline><outline text="Subtraction in 'compareTo()'" _note="
Reports subtraction in
 **compareTo()**  methods and methods implementing  **java.util.Comparator.compare()** . While it is a common idiom to
use the results of integer subtraction as the result of a  **compareTo()** 
method, this construct may cause subtle and difficult bugs in cases of integer overflow.
Comparing the integer values directly and returning  **-1** ,  **0** , or  **1**  is better practice in most cases.

  The subtraction on floating point values which is immediately cast to integral type is also warned as precision loss is possible due to
  rounding.
</p>

The warning is not issued when it's statically determined that value ranges are limited, and overflow never occurs.
Additionally subtraction on  **int**  numbers greater than or equal to  **0**  will never overflow.
Therefore this inspection tries not to warn in those cases.
Methods that always return zero or greater can be specified in this inspection's settings.

<!-- tooltip end -->

Use the table below to specify methods which are safe to use inside a subtraction.
Methods are safe when they return an  **int**  value that is always greater than or equal to  **0** .
Alternatively you may use  **javax.annotation.Nonnegative**  annotation on such methods.


" ></outline><outline text="Suspicious 'Collection.toArray()' call" _note="
Reports two types of suspicious calls to  **Collection.toArray()** .
The first type is any calls where the type of the specified array argument is not of the same type as the array type to which the result is casted.
Example:
<pre> **
void m(List list) {
  Number[] ns = (Number[])
      list.toArray(new String[0]);
}
** </pre>
The second type is any calls where the type of the specified array argument does not match the type parameter of the collection declaration.

    with itself or the method is not implemented correctly.</li>
  <li>Warns if it's evident that comparator does not return 0 for same elements. Such comparator violates the contract

Reports when <strong>list.remove(index)</strong> is called inside the ascending counted loop. This is suspicious as list becomes
shorter after that and the element next to removed will not be processed. Simple fix is to decrease the index variable after removal,
but probably removing via iterator or using <strong>removeIf</strong> method (since Java 8) is a more robust alternative.
If you don't expect that <strong>remove</strong> will be called more than once in a loop, consider adding a <strong>break</strong> command
after it.

This inspection warns when result of  **Comparator.compare**  or  **Comparable.compareTo**  is compared with
  specific non-zero constant (like  **if(a.compareTo(b) == -1)** ). By contract,
  these methods can return any positive number (not just 1) or any negative number (not just -1), so comparing against
  particular numbers is a bad practice.

Reports any calls to
 **java.lang.Class.newInstance()** .
The  **newInstance**  method propagates any
exception thrown by the no-arg constructor, including checked exceptions. Use
of this method effectively bypasses the compile-time exception checking that
would otherwise be performed by the compiler. Replacing such a method call with
a call to the  **java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance()**

" ></outline><outline text="'synchronized' method" _note="
Reports use of the  **synchronized**  modifier on methods.
There are several reasons a  **synchronized**  modifier on a method may be a bad idea:
First, as a rule as little work as possible should be performed under a lock.
Therefore it is often better to use a  **synchronized**  statement and move as much of the methods code outside the
 **synchronized**  region.
Second, it makes synchronization part of the external interface of the class.
This makes a future change to a different locking mechanism difficult.
Third, it makes it hard to track just who is locking on a given object.
And fourth, it makes a denial-of-service attack possible, either on purpose or it can happen easily by accident when subclassing.

As an alternative, consider
synchronizing on a  **private final**  lock object, access to which can be completely controlled.

A  **ThreadLocalRandom**  should not be shared between threads because that is not thread-safe.

Usages of  **ThreadLocalRandom**  should typically look like  **ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(...)**

Reports on any call to  **Object.wait()**  or  **Condition.await()**  which

In addition to being potentially extremely CPU intensive when little work is done inside the loop, such

to be hoisted out of the loop, causing the loop to never complete even if another thread does change the
field's value.

And third , it makes a denial-of-service attack possible, either on purpose or it can happen easily by accident when subclassing.

As an alternative, consider
synchronizing on a  **private final**  lock object, access to which can be completely controlled.

" ></outline><outline text="Synchronization on a Lock object" _note="
Reports any  **synchronized** 
block which locks on an instance of  **java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock** .
Such synchronization is almost certainly inadvertent, and appropriate versions of  **.lock()** 
and  **.unlock()**  should be used instead.
<!-- tooltip end -->


" ></outline><outline text="Synchronization on a non-final field" _note="
Reports  **synchronized**  statements where the lock expression
is a reference to a non- **final**  field. Such statements are unlikely to have useful semantics, as different
threads may be locking on different objects even when operating on the same object.
<!-- tooltip end -->


" ></outline><outline text="Synchronization on an object initialized with a literal" _note="
Reports any  **synchronized** 
block which locks on an object which is initialized with a literal.
String literals are interned and Character, Boolean and Number literals can be allocated from a cache.
Because of this, it is possible that some other part of the system
which uses an object initialized with the same literal, is actually holding a
reference to the exact same object. This can create unexpected dead-lock situations,
if the lock object was thought to be private.
<!-- tooltip end -->

Use the checkbox below to warn on any synchronization on String, Character, Boolean and Number objects.


" ></outline><outline text="Synchronization on local variable or method parameter" _note="
Reports synchronization on a local variable or parameter.
It is very difficult to guarantee correctness when such synchronization is used.
It may be possible to improve code like this by controlling access through e.g. a synchronized wrapper class,
or by synchronizing on a field.
<!-- tooltip end -->


" ></outline><outline text="ThreadLocal field not declared static final" _note="
Reports fields of type  **java.lang.ThreadLocal**  which are not declared  **static final** .
In the most common case a  **java.lang.ThreadLocal**  instance
associates state with a thread. A non-static non-final
 **java.lang.ThreadLocal**  field associates state with
an instance-thread combination. This is seldom necessary and often a bug
which can cause memory leaks and possibly incorrect behavior.
<!-- tooltip end -->

This inspection has a quick fix to make the field  **static final** 


" ></outline><outline text="Unconditional 'wait()' call" _note="
Reports  **.wait()** 
being called unconditionally within a synchronized context.
Normally,  **.wait()**  is
used to block a thread until some condition is true. If  **.wait()** 
is called unconditionally, that often indicates that the condition was checked before a lock was
acquired. In that case a data race may occur, with the condition becoming true between the time
it was checked and the time the lock was acquired. While constructs found by this inspection
are not necessarily incorrect, they are certainly worth examining.

" ></outline><outline text="Volatile array field" _note="
Reports array fields
which are declared as  **volatile** . Such fields
may be confusing, as accessing the array itself follows the rules for  **volatile** 
fields, but accessing the array's contents does not. If such volatile access is needed to array contents,
the JDK5.0  **java.util.concurrent.atomic**  classes should be used instead.

Reports any fields which are not used in the  **toString()**  method of a class. This can be useful to discover
fields that were added after the  **toString()**  method was created and for which the  **toString()**  method was not
correctly adjusted. It is possible to exclude fields from this check in the settings accessible via the Generate > toString() dialog.

Reports conditions that become redundant as they are completely covered by a subsequent condition.
For example, in the  **value != -1 && value > 0**  condition, the first part is redundant:
if it's false, then the second part is also false.
Or in a condition like  **obj != null && obj instanceof String** ,
the null-check is redundant as  **instanceof**  operator implies non-nullity.

" ></outline><outline text="Multiple occurrences of the same expression" _note="
Reports multiple equivalent occurrences of the same expression within a method (or constructor, or class initializer)

<!-- tooltip end -->

  The expression is reported if it's free of side effects and its result is always the same (in terms of  **Object.equals()** ).
  The examples of such expressions are  **a + b** ,  **Math.max(a, b)** ,  **a.equals(b)** ,
   **s.substring(a,b)** . To make sure the result is always the same, it's verified that the variables used in the expression don't
  change their values between the occurrences of the expression.</p>

  Such expressions may contain methods of immutable classes like  **String** ,  **BigDecimal** , etc,
  and of utility classes like  **Objects** ,  **Math**  (except  **random()** ).
  The well-known methods, such as  **Object.equals()** ,  **Object.hashCode()** ,  **Object.toString()** ,
   **Comparable.compareTo()** , and  **Comparator.compare()**  are OK as well because they normally don't have
  any observable side effects.

Reports unnecessarily complex collection operations which have simpler alternatives. E.g.
 **Arrays.asList(array).subList(0, 10).toArray(new String[0])**  could be simplified to
 **Arrays.copyOfRange(array, 0, 10)**  or  **collection.containsAll(singletonList('x'))**  could be

Reports a variety of redundant String-related operations like calling  **String.toString()**  or  **String.substring(0)** .
Also, reports usage of redundant String constructors like  **new String()**  (equivalent to  **''** ) or  **new String(anotherString)** 
(equivalent to  **anotherString** ). Such code, when fixed, may change the program semantics if String referential equality is

" ></outline><outline text="Redundant type arguments" _note="

Reports all calls to parametrized methods where explicit argument types
can be omitted, since they will be unambiguously inferred by compiler. 
Such usages make code excessive and thus less readable. 
 
For example if you have a call to parametrized method like:
 <pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **<font color='#000080'>this</font>** .&lt;String&gt;addItem(<font color='#008000'>''</font>);

Reports type casts which could be removed if the variable type is narrowed to the cast type. Example:
<pre>
  Object x = '  string  ';
  System.out.println(((String)x).trim());
</pre>
Here changing the type of  **x**  to  **String**  will make the cast redundant. The suggested quick-fix updates variable type and

Both suspend functions and  **CoroutineScope**  members & extensions have access to  **coroutineContext** .

it has ambiguous access to  **CoroutineContext** :
first via  **kotlin.coroutines.coroutineContext**  and second via  **CoroutineScope.coroutineContext** ,

So when we call some  **CoroutineScope**  extension or access  **coroutineContext**  from such a function,

Reports anonymous capturing groups and numeric back references in a RegExp.
These are only reported when the RegExp dialect supports named group and named group references.
Named groups and named back references improve code readability and are recommended to use instead.
When a capture is not needed, matching can be more performant and use less memory by using a non-capturing group,
i.e.  **(?:xxx)**  instead of  **(xxx)** .

  -->

Reports  **^**  or  **\A**  anchors not at the beginning of the pattern and
 **$** ,  **\Z**  or  **\z**  anchors not at the end of the pattern.
In the wrong position these RegExp anchors prevent the pattern from matching anything.
In case of the  **^**  and  **$**  anchors, most likely the literal character was meant and the escape forgotten.

  -->

Reports multiple consecutive spaces in a RegExp.
Because spaces are not visible by default, it can be hard to see how many spaces are required.
The RegExp can be made more clear by replacing the consecutive spaces with a single space and a counted quantifier.

  -->

Reports duplicate branches in a RegExp alternation. For example  **(a|b|a)** .
Duplicate branches slow down matching and obscure the intent of the expression.

  -->

Reports empty branches in a RegExp alternation. For example:
  **a **||** b** 
An empty branch will only match the empty string, and in most cases that is not what is desired.
This inspection will not report a single empty branch at the start or the end of an alternation.

  ~ Copyright 2000-2018 JetBrains s.r.o. Use of this source code is governed by the Apache 2.0 license that can be found in the LICENSE file.
  -->

Reports the escaped meta characters, e.g.  ** **\.** ** .
Some RegExp coding styles specify that meta characters should be placed inside a character class,
to make the regular expression easier to understand.
For example the regex  ** **\d+\.\d+** **  would be written as  **\d+[.]\d+** .
This inspection does not warn about the meta character  ** **[** ** ,  ** **]** **  and  ** **^** ** ,
because those would need additional escaping inside a character class.

Reports octal escapes, which are easily confused with back references.
Use hexadecimal escapes to avoid confusion.

  ~ Copyright 2000-2018 JetBrains s.r.o. Use of this source code is governed by the Apache 2.0 license that can be found in the LICENSE file.
  -->

Reports character escapes that are replaceable with the unescaped character without a change in meaning.
Note that inside the square brackets of a character class, many escapes are unnecessary that would be necessary outside of a character class.
For example the regex  ** **[\.]** **  is identical to  ** **[.]** **

" ></outline><outline text="Single character alternation" _note="<!--
  ~ Copyright 2000-2018 JetBrains s.r.o. Use of this source code is governed by the Apache 2.0 license that can be found in the LICENSE file.
  -->

Reports single char alternation ( ** **a|b|c|d** ** ) in a RegExp.
It is simpler and significantly faster to use a character class ( ** **[abcd]** ** ) instead.
